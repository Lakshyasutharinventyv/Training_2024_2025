# Task-1 Python Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts divided into **Selection**, **Sequence**, and **Iteration** based on their primary functionality.

---

## **1. Selection**

Scripts that involve decision-making using conditions:

- **`max_of_x_y_z.py`**: Determines the maximum among three given numbers.
- **`param_rect.py`**: Calculates the perimeter of a rectangle based on its dimensions.

---

## **2. Sequence**

Scripts that follow a specific order of execution without conditional branching:

- **`area_of_circle.py`**: Computes the area of a circle given its radius.
- **`print_1_to_5.py`**: Prints numbers from 1 to 5.
- **`print_1,_2,_3,-4,-5,_6,_7,-8,...n.py`**: Prints a sequence alternating between positive and negative numbers.
- **`print_1,1,2,1,1,2,3,2,1,1,2,3,4,3,2,1,...n.py`**: Prints a nested pattern of numbers.
- **`print_1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,...n.py`**: Prints another variation of a nested number sequence.
- **`sum_of_1_to_5.py`**: Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.

---

## **3. Iteration**

Scripts that use loops to perform repetitive tasks:

- **`fact_1_to_5.py`**: Computes the factorials of numbers from 1 to 5.
- **`print_1!,3!,5!,7!,9!,...n.py`**: Prints factorials of odd numbers in a sequence.
- **`sin_function.py`**: Evaluates the sine function for a series of inputs.
